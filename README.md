Analysis of YouTube Comments using R

Discussion:
When starting this project, I planned to work on two songs used for two FIFA World Cups, respectively, 2010 and 2022. One is Shakira - Waka Waka (This Time for Africa) and another is Light The Sky with Nora Fatehi, Balqees, Rahma Riad, Manal & RedOne. When I analyzed these two videos, I noticed that many people worldwide commented on different languages, emojis, and cultural differences. The primary thing is for the second song; most comments were in the Arabic characters. That means 2022 FIFA world cup will be in Qatar, so it will be based in the middle east. 

From my analysis, I was clear that for content, there would be a regional language majority, like comments, likes, dislikes, and sharing. For wordcloud, It's classified as major words like Song, World, FIFA. Another interesting this is that for both songs, I had Shakira. This means most people mentioned her name, and it's proved that her song was the best one till now.
